To get list of all problems there is a public api which contains problems and their related tags. <https://codeforces.com/api/problemset.problems>

## Contests

There are two types of contests for `div1` and `div2` happen,
`div1` is for experienced uses and
`div1` is for uses with less experience.

You can also start virtual contest to practice any past contest.
After contest is finished editorial of every coding contest are released.

In codeforces there is concept of hacking a problem.
Which means finding some problem with question.
You can also challenge someone solution if it showed as passed.
You have to prove it wrong (by giving some testcase).
A successful hack will also result in increase in your rating.
