This repos/site contains my competitive programming solutions
and some templates and scripts that I use for competitive programming.
It also contains links to other resource of competitive programming.
In articles I have overviews and classifications of problems and techniques
used in competitive programming. Also in some cases there is intuition
provided for certain algorithms.

!!! note

    If you find any mistake open an issue and then mention your
    pull request in that issue.

## Introduction

This website is divided into many sections and major one of them are:

- **Algorithms** - This contains all about algorithms analysis, time complexity,
    and different algorithms on data structure.
- **Data Structures** - This contains implementation on data structures in C and C++
