# Sorting

Sorting is one of the basic operation you can perform on
a given collection of item.
For sorting you need some basis of comparison and the order
in which you want to sort.

A simple use of sorting is when you want to search form item
many times you can sort them and then use binary search.

Also note that you cannot make a sorting algorithm with time complexity
less than $O(\log n)$ if we use the comparison model for computation.

Here is list of some common sorting algorithms:

- [Bubble Sort](bubble.md)
- [Insertion Sort](insertion.md)
- [Selection Sort](selection.md)
- [Heap Sort](heap.md)
- [Count Sort](count.md)
- [Quick Sort](quick.md)
- [Merge Sort](merge.md)
- [Radix Sort](radix.md)
