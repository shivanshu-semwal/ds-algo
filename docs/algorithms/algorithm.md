# Algorithm

Algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions,
typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

## Measuring space and time complexity

How we measure space and time complexity of algorithm depend on the computational model
we are trying to use. Generally we use turing model of computing.
