# Arrays

Arrays are the most basic data structure.
The intuition behind using arrays is that, you put your data in contiguous location.
And if you want to get location of $i$ th data element you can get by adding the
size of each data item times $i$ and the offset of the first item.

Some common operations you can perform on arrays are:

- Searching
- [Sorting](./sorting/README.md)
