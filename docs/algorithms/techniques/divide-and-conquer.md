# Divide and Conquer

- first you divide in subproblem
- then you merge them

OR

- you do some computation
- then you crete two or more same subproblem to solve

## Time Complexity

- you have to make a recurrence relation for time complexity, and then solve it using Masters Theorem.

## Merge Sort

- split array into two
- sort them recursively
- merge them

## quick sort

- find pivot, and separate elements
- sort the other parts recursively
