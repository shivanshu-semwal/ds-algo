# Matrix chain multiplications type problem

## description

- you are given an array, or a string
- you have to calculate something which depends on the subarray between the range

## recursive code

```cpp
{{ include_file('matrix-chain-multiplication/recurse.cpp') }}
```

## memoization sol

```cpp
{{ include_file('matrix-chain-multiplication/memoize.cpp') }}
```

## top down approach

```cpp
{{ include_file('matrix-chain-multiplication/top-down.cpp') }}
```
