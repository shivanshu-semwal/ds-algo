# Longest common subsequence type problem

## description

- you are given an two array or and string
- to compare two ends of string and make some choice

## recursive code

```cpp
{{ include_file('longest-common-subsequence/recurse.cpp') }}
```

## memoization sol

```cpp
{{ include_file('longest-common-subsequence/memoize.cpp') }}
```

## top down approach

```cpp
{{ include_file('longest-common-subsequence/top-down.cpp') }}
```
