# Introduction

Several methods are used to solve problems in
competitive programming.
Sometime we may have to use one or more technique in
combination with each other.

Here are some common method which are used:

- [Bit Manipulation](bit-manipulation.md)
- [Divide and Conquer](divide-and-conquer.md)
- [Dynamic Programming](dynamic-programming.md)
- [Greedy](greedy.md)
- [Sliding Window](sliding-window.md)
- [Sweep Line](sweep-line.md)
- [Two Pointer](two-pointer.md)
- [Monotonic Stack](monotonic-stack.md)
