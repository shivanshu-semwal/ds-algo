# Algorithmic Techniques

Several methods are used to solve problems in competitive programming.
Sometime we may have to use one or more technique in combination with each other.

Here are some common method which are used:

## Broad Category of Methods

- [Divide and Conquer](divide-and-conquer.md)
- [Dynamic Programming](dynamic-programming.md)
- [Greedy](greedy.md)

## Special Techniques

- [Sliding Window](sliding-window.md)
- [Two Pointer](two-pointer.md)
- [Sweep Line](sweep-line.md)
- [Monotonic Stack](monotonic-stack.md)
- [Fast and Slow Pointers]
- [Two Heaps]
- [Binary Search]

## Using Special Data Structure

- [Disjoint Set]
- [Trie]

## Tricks rather than algorithms

- [Bit Manipulation](bit-manipulation.md)
