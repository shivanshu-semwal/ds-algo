## Data Structures

Some algorithms need data to be structured in certain way
for them to work efficiently. This is what data structures provide.
How the data is arranged in memory is defined by data structures

Data structure is data organization, management and storage format
that is usually chosen for efficient access to data.
Data structure is a collection of data values and the
relationship among them and the functions or operations that
can be applied on the data.

### Abstract data type

Abstract data type are mathematical model of data types.
They define functionality but not how they are implemented.
For e.g. stack provide functionality to pop and push items
but it can be implemented in multiple ways.
ADT are present from the view of a user and data types
from the point of view of who is going to implement it.

### Outline

- Data Structure
    - Classification:
        - Linear: static, dynamic
        - Non Linear
- Array
    - dynamic array
    - create, insert, delete
- Linked List
    - Types: Single, double, circular
    - Operation: insertion, deletion, searching
- Stack: push, pop
- Queue:
    - Priority Queue
- Tree
    - Binary Tree
        - Binary Heap
        - Binary search tree
            - avl tree
            - red black tree
            - splay tree
    - Segment tree
    - Trie
    - Binary Indexed Tree
    - suffix array and suffix tree
    - B-Tree
    - k dimensional tree
- Graph
- Hashing

## A note about programming language

Many languages provides some basic type of data structures and data
types (primitive data types). If you use low level programming language you
use to implement the data structure you will have more control over it's
execution. For example take C and Python, in python you don't have pointers
so you will not be able to do certain optimization on data structures.
But in C you will have to write more code.
