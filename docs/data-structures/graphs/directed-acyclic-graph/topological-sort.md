# Topological sort

> possible only for directed acyclic graphs

- find all possible topological graphs
- methods
    - dfs
    - khan's algo
- maximum edges that can be added to dag so it still remains dag
- longest path between pair of vertices
- longest path in dag

## Sample Implementation

```cpp
{{ include_file('topological_sort.cpp') }}
