# Some common graph terminology

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory>

## Connected components

- A component of a undirected graph is a connected subgraph
  that is not part of any larger connected subgraph.

## Strongly connected components (SCC)

- for directed graphs
- a digraph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex can be reached
  from every other vertex
- the scc of a digraph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected

## Bridges (isthmus, cut-edge, or cut arc)

- a edge in graph whose removal increase the number of connected components

## Articulation Points (cut vertex)

- vertex which when removed along with associated edges, increases the
  connected components

## Clique

- Clique is a subset of vertices of undirected graph, such that every two  
  distinct vertices in clique are adjacent.
